# Cosmwasm-compatible Rust targeting Transpiler

This transpiler should share as many code as possible with crate::interpreter. Code maintainability is important, and if we can just emit the rust AST that does the same thing with the interpreter we can work on a single runtime codebase(transpiler will be just a macro). 

Will be impled after interp.

# Bytecode VM

// TODO, low priority

checklists:
- Is it worth to implement considering that interpreter and transpiler will be impled in prior?
- The bytecode format is from Moddable's XS engine, check license problem 

Honestely I think Jessie grammar is simple enough to implement portable interpreter over many languages by hand and get enough performance without relying on a VM runtime. I am just leaving the code here because I am lazy.
